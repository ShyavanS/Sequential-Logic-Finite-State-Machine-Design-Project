# Sequential Logic Finite-State Machine Design Project

Final design project for an Engineering Physics course at McMaster University. A finite-state machine that was designed using the ICs available to us and NI Multisim to produce a device that cycled through a student number on a 7-segment display demonstrating knowledge of sequential logic. 

This was made on a breadboard with several J-!K Flip-Flop ICs, logic gates, and a BCD to 7SD decoder. The circuit design was drafted in NI Multisim. Feel free to view the pdf report for more information.
